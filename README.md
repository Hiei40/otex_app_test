A Flutter application demonstrating modern mobile development practices and clean architecture principles.
Project Overview
This application showcases professional Flutter development using industry-standard tools and patterns, including state management with Cubit and local data persistence with SQLite.
Tech Stack & Architecture
Core Technologies

Flutter - Cross-platform mobile development framework
Cubit (Bloc Pattern) - Lightweight state management solution for predictable state handling
SQLFlite - Local SQLite database for efficient data persistence and offline functionality

Architecture Patterns

Clean Architecture principles
Separation of concerns (Presentation, Business Logic, Data layers)
Reactive programming with streams

Key Features

✅ State management using Cubit for scalable and maintainable code
✅ Local database integration with SQLFlite for offline-first experience
✅ CRUD operations with proper error handling
✅ Responsive UI design
✅ Type-safe data models
